Array properties


Arrays, like strings, have a length property. The length is the number of items in the array.
You can check this by starting a node console in your terminal.

$ node
> let arr = [1, 2, 3];
undefined
> arr
[1, 2, 3]
> arr.length
3

Manipulating arrays
You can get a single value out of an array using bracket notation.

$ node
> let ingredients = ["Flour", "Water", "Salt"];
undefined
> ingredients[0]
Flour
> ingredients[1]
Water
> ingredients.length
3

Did you notice how we use [0] to get the first value? 
In programming we count starting at zero. This is called zero-indexing.
The number inside the brackets is called an index. Index means the
position of the item within the array.
You can set a value using bracket notation and an assignment operator (=).

const scores = [80, 41, 47];

scores[2] = 29; // Change the last score
scores[3] = 51; // Add a new score

EXERCISE
Create an array with the names of the people in your group
console.log out the names and how many people are in the group
Put someone from another group at the beginning of the array
Add someone else to the end of the list


Working with Arrays

When working with lists, you often need to manipulate, enhance,
 or search the information in that list.

Some examples of things you might want to do with a list of data:

Only use the first 10 items in a list
Get people from a list whose name starts with a M
Find the first person in a list to be over 100 years old
Arrange people in a list alphabetically
Get the last 10 items in an array
Add all the numbers up in a list
Get all the cats in an array of animals
From a list of numbers, add a Â£ sign prefix
Combine a list of romance films and thrillers

EXERCISE
Working as a group - use the MDN documentation on arrays to see if you 
can find what methods might be useful to achieving the above examples.
