/*Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as
you ask them to. They take an input and return an output.

Here's a function that doubles a number: */
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}
//To use a function then we we need to call it ( some people will say invoke )
const result = double(2);

console.log(result); // 4
/*The function double is being called by placing parathenses after
 the name of the function like this double()

ðŸ”‘ The input given to a function is called a argument

ðŸ”‘ A parameter is a variable that is used to refer to an argument

In the example above, we're saying that inside the function double, 
there is a variable called number, but we don't know what the value
 of the variable is until someone calls the function, at which point
they will give a value for that variable.

A function can have one or more parameters, check out the example below: */

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(10, 32)); // 5

/*In the function add, the parameters are a and b.

If we call the function like this add(10, 32) then we're passing 2 
arguments (or inputs) into the function : 10 and 32. We can use any
 expression as an argument.

When you write a function (sometimes called declaring a function)
you can define the parameters with any valid variable name.

The function below does exactly the same thing as the one above: */
function adding(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
/*EXERCISE 1
Create a function called formatPenceToPounds that should

take a number as an input ( representing an amount of money in pence )
return a string starting with a Â£ sign and the input number converted to pounds.
For example, formatPenceToPounds(199) should evaluate to "Â£1.99"

In your groups, think carefully about the following things:

what the parameter name should be
creating good names for any variables you use
don't use console.log inside the body of the function
Call formatPenceToPounds a few times with different inputs 
and console.log the outputs in order to check your function. ðŸ™‚ */

function formatPenceToPounds(num) {
  return `Â£${(num /100)}`;
}
//Why it didn't work with toFixed(2) 
console.log(formatPenceToPounds(199)); // "Â£1.99"

//Check out the code below:
function printMessage(x) {
  console.log("Hello, nice to meet you " + x);
}

function getMessage(name) {
  return "Hello, nice to meet you " + name;
}

printMessage("Mitch");

printMessage("August");

getMessage("Laetitia");

/*The functions above behave similarly but differ in some important ways.

In groups, study the code above and then answer the following questions:

How many times is the function printMessage called ?
How many times is the function getMessage called ?
What is the parameter name for the function printMessage ?
What is the parameter name for the function getMessage ?
Discuss briefly which parameter name is better out of the two functions and why ?

What is the return value of the function printMessage whenever it is called ?
Someone then creates 2 further variables messageForAli and curiousMessage: */
const messageForAli = getMessage("Ali");

const curiousMessage = getMessage(42);
/*f) What will the variable messageForAli evaluate to when the code above
is executed ? g) What will the variable curiousMessage 
evaluate to when the code above is executed ?

Remember you can use console.log to log variables in order to check your answers to f) and g)

Hint: Think carefully about the parameters and arguments for getMessage for part g) */
console.log(messageForAli);
console.log(curiousMessage);
