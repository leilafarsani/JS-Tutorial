/*Hello World
It is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any 
language is make it output 'Hello world!'.
We'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called console.log(). 
The console.log() method (log is method or console.log is method ?)))
writes a message to the console.
The console is a tool which is mainly used to log information - it's
 useful for testing purposes.

- The log() method writes (logs) a message to the console.
- The log() method is useful for testing purposes.
 EXERCISE
(This exercise will help you understand how to run a basic JS script 
and explore the different ways you can run JS code)
Create your first js1-week1.js script
Type console.log("Hello World!")
There are 2 ways you can run this script - one way is by pressing F5 
in your VS Code application. Can you find out what the second way is? 
Pair up and use a search engine to find out! Choose your favourite method 
and use that from now on. :::
BONUS: there is a third way of running JS code (notice how I haven't 
said scipt) - do you know what that is?
 */
console.log("Hello World!");
/*
EXERCISE
(This exercise will help you expand your understanding of console.log)

Write 10 statements like these, but in different languages.

For example:
Halo, dunia! // Indonesian
Ciao, mondo! // Italian
Hola, mundo! // Spanish

Note that,
You can run node by itself, which will open a node console, 
also called a Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL).
A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell,
is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs,
 executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment
is executed piecewise
This console allows you to enter code in the console line by line 
and is a great way of testing bits of code before writing it in a script. 
Each time you press enter, it will print out what the expression you typed evaluates to.
In your terminal, run the command node and then enter a line of code from the code below
and then run enter. Do this for each line of code in the list.

What is comments, how do we make them, why they are useful.
It helps for code reading and reviewing for others and ourselves in the future, debugging,  */
