/*Hello World
It is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any 
language is make it output 'Hello world!'.
We'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called console.log(). 
The console.log() method writes a message to the console.
The console is a tool which is mainly used to log information - it's
 useful for testing purposes.
 EXERCISE
(This exercise will help you understand how to run a basic JS script 
and explore the different ways you can run JS code)
Create your first js1-week1.js script
Type console.log("Hello World!")
There are 2 ways you can run this script - one way is by pressing F5 
in your VS Code application. Can you find out what the second way is? 
Pair up and use a search engine to find out! Choose your favourite method 
and use that from now on. :::
BONUS: there is a third way of running JS code (notice how I haven't 
said scipt) - do you know what that is?
 */
console.log("Hello World!")
