/*Variables
When you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values 
so you don't have to write out the same value every time.
We can use a variable to create a reference to a value. Variables 
can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these 
containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. 
Variables are declared with let and const keywords as follows.*/
let greeting = "Hello world";
console.log(greeting);
const name = "Irina";
console.log(name);
/*
EXERCISE

to the variable Print your greeting to the console 3 times. You should see your
greeting 3 times on the console, one on each line.
 */
let greetings = "How are you doing?"
console.log(greetings);
console.log(greetings);
console.log(greetings);
