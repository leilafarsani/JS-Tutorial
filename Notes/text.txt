NOTE THAT:
We cant change string by index like arrays.
It's because string is primitive type so they are immutable.
However, arrays are reference type so they are mutable
so we can change some elements of it by [index].

We can change string with replace method.

Question?
Why we cant define our variable in for loop with const

let myName = "HELLO WORLD";
myName =myName.replace("HELLO", "hi");
console.log(myName); 

LET AND CONST :(LOOPS)
In general for loop we can't use const because the value of 
variable is modified by increment one until the condition is false.
However, in for of loop the constant variable(random) 
hold each values of that array.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN i++ and ++i :
